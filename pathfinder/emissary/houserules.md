[ character creation ]<br>
- no ancestry/background/class/ability/spell is barred but must come from published material and not forum or message board post.
- alignments are private. players must generally adhere to their own alignment and morality, but it does not need to be identified.
- players beginning at level 1 may only carry and use a single weapon, either 2hand, dual wield, or shield. all other weapons granted are converted to currency.
- beginning coin is calculated after all starting equipment is resolved then dividing by 10 and multiplying by starting level (ie level 3 characer with 15 gold: 15g / 10 = 1g5s * 3 = 4g5s).

[ currency ]<br>
- 10 silver = 1 gold
- 10 copper = 1 silver

[ combat ]<br>
- movement and speed are at appropriate distance without the use of grid squares.
- initiative ties are resolved with enemies first, players actions at the same time.
